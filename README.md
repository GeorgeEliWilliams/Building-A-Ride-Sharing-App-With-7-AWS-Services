# Ride Sharing App Using AWS Services

## Project Description:
This project focuses on building a ride sharing app within the AWS ecosystem. The goal is to streamline the handling of images by automatically resizing them and transferring them to a designated storage location while keeping stakeholders informed through notifications. Key AWS services, such as Lambda, S3, and SNS, are used to orchestrate this workflow.

## AWS Services to be used:
1.	Codecommit
2.	Amplify
3.	Cognito
4.	Lambda
5.	IAM
6.	API Gateway
7.	DynamoDB


## Key Features:
•	All the code is provided by AWS and we need a way to get it into a source control system
•	We need to be able to handle permissions for the code
•	A place to host the website and also make updates
•	A way for users to register and login
•	We need some ride sharing functionality
•	Somewhere to store and return the ride results
•	We need a way to invoke the ride sharing functionality from the browser


## Steps :
### Step 1 :
### Creating Source and Designation s3 Buckets :

1. Navigate to the S3 Console.
2. Follow the Outlined Steps below.

3. Create the destination bucket using the same steps and name it with a unique name.

4. As you can see above , I created two buckets one is Source bucket and another one is Destination bucket.

### Step 2 :
### Creating the SNS Notification :

1. Navigate to the SNS console.
2. Follow the Outlined Steps below.

3. Scroll down and Click "Create subscription" <br>
4. After this , you will receive some mail for Subscription Confirmation and you have to confirm that.<br>
5. You can use any other protocols also like SQS, HTTP, SMS etc .,<br>

### Step 3 :
### Creating the Lambda :

1. Navigate to the Lambda Console.
2. Follow the Outlined steps below.

![i14](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/c90eaf3b-2a38-46dc-80f2-a097febf0e95)

3. Now replace the default code with the image-resizing-s3.py and deploy the changes , Don't test the code now we have to do some more actions before testing.
4. After that , We have to give some permission for our Lambda Function to do our process (resizing) , For that navigate to the IAM Console and follow the below steps.

5. Now navigate to the Lambda Console and follow the steps below.


![i23](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/17797c6b-109c-455d-ae15-d412b83182fe)


![i24](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/fd489e94-5129-4bee-a682-ad24a2685233)

6. Now we have to trigger the function.


![i26](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/166aadb1-4d3a-40d8-a70e-681ea507e1d1)


![i27](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/b8dcb311-1914-47bc-96a7-5df62a283954)

7. Now we have to go to code section , and scroll down to  layers.<br>
8. We have to add layer .<br>
9. May be you can think , why ?<br>
10. It's because for resize the image we upload in our source S3 bucket , We need a python library called pillow in our code to resize the image . We can manually add Pillow library also, But it's very time consuming and you have to do lot more , Instead of manually adding pillow library we are going to use layers for Some easy action.<br>
11. Follow the outlined Steps below.


![i51](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/a4500c08-8a18-4a26-844a-5ad7712ba310)

12.You can copy the arn from below.

```
arn:aws:lambda:ap-south-1:770693421928:layer:Klayers-p39-pillow:1
```

13. After done all the actions above , now we can test our code.

![i49](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/fa884cf6-e858-44c4-ac03-fa4b4c0de763)

14. It will show some results like below , It runs successfully but return some error because we still not upload the images in S3 yet.


![i50 1](https://github.com/itz-mathesh/image-resizing-using-s3-lambda-and-sns/assets/144098846/d4d73c43-32aa-4ada-bed0-3aa30dd053e4)


### Step 4 :
### Results :

1. Navigate to the S3 Console.
2. Upload Some images in  Source Bucket.
